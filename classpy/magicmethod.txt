 Comparison 

OPERATION OVERLOADING:
* Operation overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning
* For example: A+ operator is used to add the numeric values as well as to concatenate the strings. That's because + is overloaded for int class and str class.
* But we can give extra meaning to this + operator and use it with our own defined class. this method of giving extra meaning to the operators is called opration overloading.
* Operator overloading is a form of compile-time polymorphism.
* When we use operators, a special function or magic function is automatically invoked that is associated with that particular operator. For example: when we use + operator the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.
* So by changing this magic method's code we can give extra meaning to the + operator.
