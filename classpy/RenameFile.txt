				Renaming and deleting a file:
*The os module in python has various methods that can be used to perform file-processing operations like renaming and deleting file.
*The rename() method takes two arguments, the current filename and new filename.
 
Syntax: os.rename(old_file_name,new_file_name)
where 'old_file_name' is the current name of the file and 'new_file_name' is the new name of the file.
 
*the remove() method can be used to delete file(s).

Syntax: os.remove(file_name)
where 'file_name' is name of the file to be deleted.

				DIRECTORY METHODS:

*the mkdir() method of the os module is used to create directories in the current directory.
                       os.mkdir("new_dir_name")
*the getcwd() method is used to display the current working directory(cwd).
                       os.getcwd()
*the chdir() method is used to change the current directory
                       os.chdir("dir_name")
*the rmdir() method is used to remove or delete a directory.
 Before removing a directory, it should be absolutely empty and all contents in it should be removed.
                       os.rmdir("dir_name")

				LISTING FILES OF A DIRECTORY:

the os.walk() method generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up.
